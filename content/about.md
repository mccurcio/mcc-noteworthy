I have a broad background and believe that this works to my advantage.

During my early graduate school days, I studied under a professor who worked with mammalian cell culture, biochemical tests, immunological tests all in a broad-minded Chemistry department. Since that time, I have worked in several successful biotechnology companies.

This broad-minded approach has stayed with me.

Since leaving biotechnology, I applied for a teaching certificate in Rhode Island and taught with students K-12. I have taught mathematics, biology, physics, and chemistry.

After teaching for several years, I realized that I loved science too much to leave it. So I applied to graduate school again. This time I was interested in studying Bioinformatics. From this point, I became interested in Data Science.

I am currently a Co-Organizer for [WebDev RI](https://www.meetup.com/webdevri/),   
and a member of the [Providence Data Science Project](https://www.meetup.com/Providence-Data-Science-Project/).
